> `bunwind` is a minimal monorepo powered by [Bun](https://bun.sh), [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com), and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) using native [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces).
>
> It demonstrates a clean setup for a shared UI package (`@bunwind/ui`) and a frontend app (`@bunwind/web`), with a strong focus on modular design, styling with Tailwind v4, and modern TypeScript tooling.

## ðŸ“š Structure

This README is **Step One** in setting up the monorepo root.

- **This file/Step One** `README.md` â€“ Root-level setup and configuration
- **Next/Step Two** `packages/ui/README.md` â€“ UI library setup (`@bunwind/ui`)
- **Final/Step Three** `packages/web/README.md` â€“ Next.js app setup (`@bunwind/web`)

# ðŸ§± Step One: Root Monorepo Setup

## 1. Create the Monorepo Root

```bash
mkdir bunwind && cd bunwind && bun init -y
```

This command initializes a basic Bun project and generates:

```
bunwind/
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules/
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ bun.lock
â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

---

## 2. Clean the Root

### âœ… Delete unnecessary files:

```bash
rm index.ts
rm tsconfig.json
rm -rf node_modules
```

- `index.ts`: You are not building or running code from the root. Remove it.
- `tsconfig.json`: You are not *technically* building or running code from the root. Remove it.
- `node_modules/`: Bun installs type packages by default here (e.g. `@types/bun`, `typescript`, etc.). These are not used at the root and will be reinstalled properly in each workspace as needed.

---

## 3. Update `package.json`

Open the file and edit it to look **exactly like this**:

```json
{
  "name": "bunwind",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["packages/*"]
}
```

- `private: true`: Prevents accidental publishing of the monorepo root.
- `workspaces`: Tells Bun to treat all subfolders inside `packages/` as isolated workspace packages.
- Remove all other fields. There should be no `main`, `exports`, `module`, `dependencies`, or `devDependencies` here.

This is the minimal and correct monorepo root `package.json`.

---

## 4. âœ… No Additional Dependencies Required

You **do not** need to install any packages at the root level.

Bun and TypeScript both support `baseUrl` and `paths` natively. No runtime or node modules are required at the root unless you later add tooling (like Biome, ESLint, Prettier, etc.). We will configure TypeScript properly inside each workspace where needed â€” and those packages will install their own `typescript` if required.

---

## âœ… Final Structure

After following all steps, your root directory should look like this:

```
bunwind/
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ bun.lock
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json         âœ… Clean and minimal
â””â”€â”€ README.md            âœ… This file
```

---

## ðŸš€ Next Step - Create the Packages Directory

From the root (this) directory run:
```bash
mkdir packages && cd packages && mkdir ui && cd ui && bun init -y
```

We continue with the next step in the packages/ui/README.md file
